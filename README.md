# Right...

Here are some files I have found or created to use in *Home Assistant* <br>
and or *epapertags*.<br>
When I know the source of a file I have made a link to that in the description, 
sometimes the source is not available on the Internet because I have gotten help from someone in for example Discord, 
but rest assured, the hard work is not by me alone.
