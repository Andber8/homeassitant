# Right...

Here are some files I have found or created to use in **Home Assistant** <br>
and or **epapertags**.<br>
When I know the source of a file I have made a link to that in the description, <br>
sometimes the source is not available on the Internet because I have gotten help from someone in for example Discord, <br>
but rest assured, the hard work is not by me alone.
